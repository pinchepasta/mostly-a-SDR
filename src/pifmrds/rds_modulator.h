/**
 * @brief Streaming RDS baseband modulator.
 *
 * Wraps an RdsEncoder and produces the per-228-kHz-sample MPX-band RDS
 * signal: differential encoding -> RRC-shaped Manchester biphase pulses
 * (overlap-add of the precomputed RDS_PULSE_SAMPLES kernel) -> mixing onto
 * the 57 kHz subcarrier as a 4-phase walk [0, +s, 0, -s] (which is
 * sin(2 pi * 57 kHz * t) sampled at 228 kHz, i.e. exactly four samples per
 * subcarrier cycle, phase-locked to the 19 kHz pilot's rising zero crossing
 * to satisfy EN 50067).
 *
 * The modulator owns the encoder and pulls a fresh group whenever its
 * 104-bit buffer empties; callers therefore only ever interact with the
 * sample-rate output, not with bit timing or group cycling.
 *
 * @code
 * RdsModulator mod{};
 * mod.encoder().setPi(0xFFFF);
 * for (int i = 0; i < 228'000; ++i) {
 *     const float rdsSample{mod.nextSample()};   // one 228 kHz baseband sample
 *     ...
