/**
 * @brief Streaming MPX-domain processor that converts audio + RDS into
 *        per-sample frequency-deviation values for ngfmdmasync.
 *
 * Audio chain (per input channel, applied at the processor input rate):
 *   1. HPF 30 Hz   - DC block (a residual DC offset would manifest as a
 *                    constant carrier shift that wastes deviation headroom).
 *   2. Pre-emphasis (50 / 75 us) - matches the receiver's de-emphasis so
 *                    the noise floor at the detector output stays flat.
 *   3. LPF 15 kHz  - FM broadcast audio mask. Energy above 15 kHz would
 *                    spill into the 19 kHz pilot band and break stereo
 *                    receivers; even mono receivers benefit from the
 *                    out-of-band suppression.
 *
 * Mono path uses the scalar AGC overload directly. Stereo computes a
 * single shared gain from max(|L|, |R|) and applies it to both channels,
 * which preserves the stereo image (no per-channel gain warping) while
 * giving correlated mono-on-stereo material the same level as the mono
 * path - the older hypot(L, R) formulation cost ~3 dB on such material.
 *
 * Audio file decoding, loop handling, channel preservation, and source-rate
 * conversion are handled upstream by AudioPipeline. This processor receives
 * audio already running at the MPX rate and focuses on FM-broadcast DSP:
 *
 * MPX chain (at the 228 kHz MPX rate):
 *   4. Compose MPX:
 *        - mono:    audio + RDS_subcarrier
 *        - stereo:  (L+R) + pilot_19k + (L-R) * sin(2 pi 38k t) + RDS_subcarrier
 *      Phase-locked 19 kHz pilot and 38 kHz subcarrier (38 kHz = 2 * 19 kHz)
 *      use sine LUTs sized to the integer 228 kHz / pilot_freq ratios
 *      (12 phases for 19 kHz, 6 phases for 38 kHz) so no NCO arithmetic
 *      is needed at run time.
 *   5. Hard-clamp to +-peakDeviation - the AGC can briefly overshoot on a
 *      level transient and an unclamped overshoot would radiate as
 *      adjacent-channel splatter.
 *
 * @code
 * FmRdsProcessor proc{{
 *     .channels        = 2,
 *     .mpxSampleRate   = 228000,
