     * @brief Per-section pole-pair Q of an N-th order Butterworth cascade.
     *
     * An N-th order Butterworth low-pass has its poles evenly spaced on a
     * semicircle of radius omega_c in the LHP. The standard cascade design
     * groups them into N/2 complex-conjugate pairs; the k-th pair sits at
     * angle theta_k = pi * (2k - 1) / (2N) measured from the negative real
     * axis (so theta close to 0 means a near-real pole, theta close to pi/2
     * means a near-imaginary pole), and the biquad section that realises
     * that pair has denominator Q given by Q_k = 1 / (2 * cos(theta_k)).
     * Cascading those sections at the same cutoff reproduces the full
     * N-th order Butterworth response (roll-off of 6*N dB/oct, maximally
     * flat in-band).
     *
     * Computed at runtime (std::cos is not constexpr in C++20) once per
     * processor instance, so the cost is negligible. The benefit over a
     * hard-coded table is that the formula is right here, transcription errors
     * are impossible, and bumping LPF_ORDER to 6/8 only requires appending
     * matching butterworthCascadeQ(order, k) entries to the ctor init list.
     *
     * @param order   Target Butterworth order N; must be even and >= 2.
     * @param section Section index k in [1, N/2].
     * @return Pole-pair Q for the given section.
