/**
 * @brief Uniform pseudo-random noise with sample-and-hold band-limiting.
 *
 * Each random value is held for a fixed number of DMA samples before
 * regenerating. This band-limits the modulating noise so that, by Carson's
 * rule, the RF spectrum stays close to the target rectangular profile:
 * B_RF ~= bandwidth * (1 + 2 * MOD_BW_FRACTION). Updating every DMA sample
 * would instead spread the spectrum across the full sample rate.
